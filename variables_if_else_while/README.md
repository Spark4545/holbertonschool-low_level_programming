### **Betty**
<p>
Betty is a linter tool for shell scripts that is written in C programming language. It was created by Holberton School as part of their curriculum. Betty helps to detect coding style issues, syntax errors, and potential bugs in shell scripts. It enforces a set of coding standards that make the code more readable and easier to maintain. Betty is easy to install and use and can be integrated with popular text editors like Visual Studio Code and Atom.
